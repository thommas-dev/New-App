<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the initial MVP for SimplePM Board (later renamed EquipTrack), focusing on core features as prioritized by the user. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with a Kanban board and basic work orders, then progressively adding department/machine management, interactive detail views, and a calendar. Key challenges involved debugging frontend React  component issues, correcting backend  integration, and adapting to user-requested UI/UX enhancements like sidebar changes, printable workflows, and editable checklists. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in full-stack development, effectively using Shadcn UI, FastAPI, and MongoDB while adhering to strict environment and architectural guidelines. The process involved continuous feedback loops, testing, and refinement, culminating in a functional application with several core features implemented and a clear path for further development.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build EquipTrack (formerly SimplePM Board), a lightweight, Trello-style Maintenance & Repair Scheduling app. It features Kanban, Calendar, and List views for Work Orders (WOs). WOs have fields like ID, Title, Type (PM/Repair), Priority, Status, Assignee, Due Date, Checklist, Photos, and Comments. The app supports a virtual plant structure (Departments â†’ Machines) and PM Templates with recurrence. Repair requests can be converted to WOs. Only Admin and Maintenance Supervisor roles can log in. Key features implemented include:
- A functional login/registration system.
- Kanban board with Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, On Hold columns (Backlog removed).
- Department and Machine management with interactive detail views.
- Work Order creation and detail view with editable checklists and print options.
- Maintenance Work Orders page with Daily/Weekly/Monthly cards and interactive task details.
- Calendar view displaying maintenance and repair tasks.
- Daily Tasks dashboard with summary cards and task lists.
- A Support page is being added for user manual and developer contact.
- Free trial changed to 2 weeks, with a payment page transition planned.
