The AI engineer's work on EquipTrack involved extensive full-stack development, iteratively implementing and refining features based on user feedback. Initial tasks focused on payment integration with Stripe, including backend models, endpoints, and frontend UI for pricing and trial status. A significant portion of the work revolved around checklist functionality across various components (, , ), dealing with rendering errors, auto-save/manual-save toggles, and ensuring persistence and cross-page synchronization. Debugging involved fixing backend access control, API URL construction (double  paths), and frontend state management. Multiple rounds of user-reported issues (UI text, display percentages, modal closing behavior, data loading failures) led to deep dives into specific component logic and the introduction of client-side data synchronization. The trajectory concludes with the engineer acknowledging fundamental checklist persistence issues, receiving a detailed technical solution from the user, and starting to implement it, demonstrating a commitment to thoroughly resolving complex bugs.

The EquipTrack (formerly SimplePM Board) application aims to be a lightweight, Trello-style Maintenance & Repair Scheduling app. It features Kanban, Calendar, and List views for Work Orders (WOs). WOs include fields like ID, Title, Type (PM/Repair), Priority, Status, Assignee, Due Date, Checklist, Photos, and Comments. The app supports a virtual plant structure (Departments â†’ Machines) and PM Templates with recurrence. Repair requests can be converted to WOs. Only Admin and Maintenance Supervisor roles can log in.

**Implemented Features:**
- Functional login/registration system.
- Kanban board with Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, On Hold columns.
- Department and Machine management with interactive detail views.
- Work Order creation and detail view with editable checklists and print options.
- Maintenance Work Orders page with Daily/Weekly/Monthly cards and interactive task details.
- Calendar view displaying maintenance and repair tasks.
- Daily Tasks dashboard with summary cards and task lists.
- Support page for user manual and developer contact.
- Free trial period updated from 1 month to 2 weeks, with Stripe payment integration added for subscriptions.
- Checklist percentage display on cards (later removed as per user request).
- Cross-page checklist synchronization using local storage events.
- Manual save buttons for checklists in Work Order and Maintenance Task details.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Central FastAPI application. Handles all backend logic, API routes, database operations for users, departments, machines, and work orders, including authentication with JWT.
    - **Changes**: Major additions for Stripe payment integration (models like , ), trial expiration logic, and payment-related endpoints.  was extended to  for protected routes. A missing  endpoint was added.  model was modified to include . Access control middleware was applied to various routes.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Main React component managing global state, routing, and axios interceptors for authentication and error handling.
    - **Changes**: Updated to include new routes for  and . Axios interceptor logic ensures authentication tokens are sent with requests and handles trial expiration.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Main user dashboard.
    - **Changes**: Integrated  component for displaying subscription information.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Displays work orders in a Kanban format.
    - **Changes**: Renamed Work Orders Board to Repair Work Orders. Removed Drag and drop to update status text. Initially had checklist progress display on cards (later removed).  callback in  usage was adjusted to control modal closing behavior and ensure parent refresh. Integrated  event listener for cross-page synchronization.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Manages departments, displaying cards with machine counts.
    - **Changes**:  logic was updated to refresh the machines list, ensuring accurate machine counts on department cards.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Displays and allows editing of a single work order's details, including a checklist.
    - **Changes**: Initially implemented editable checklists with auto-save (later changed to manual save). Fixed a rendering error (missing  import).  state and related logic were removed to make checklists always editable.  calls were removed from  and moved to the modal's close handler to prevent auto-closing. Fixed API URL construction (removed double  prefix). Integrated  event dispatcher for cross-page synchronization.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Manages preventive maintenance tasks.
    - **Changes**: Implemented auto-save for maintenance task checklists (later changed to manual save). Initially had progress indicators on cards (later removed). Adjusted  usage for modal closing behavior. Fixed API call in  to use  and correct URL. Integrated  event listener for cross-page synchronization and fetches real work orders.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Displays today's tasks and notifications.
    - **Changes**: Initially used static sample data, later updated to fetch real work order data for today. Implemented  for auto-save (later removed). Fixed syntax errors related to array declarations and  handling (for work orders without it). Checkboxes were made non-interactive. Progress indicators on cards were initially present (later removed). Integrated  event listener for cross-page synchronization.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Component for viewing and editing maintenance task details, including a checklist.
    - **Changes**: Added auto-save functionality for checklists (later changed to manual save). Added missing add/remove checklist functions.  calls were removed from  and moved to the modal's close handler. Fixed API call to use  and correct URL.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in fixing a critical checklist save persistence issue. Despite previous backend testing confirming API functionality, the user consistently reported that checklist changes were not persisting upon re-opening cards, leading to frustration. The user provided a detailed technical analysis, identifying three root causes: save requests being aborted when modals unmount, cache key collisions leading to stale data, and the API not returning authoritative saved items. The user also provided specific example code demonstrating the use of  and updating local state with authoritative data received from the backend. The AI engineer has acknowledged these root causes and has begun implementing the suggested solution in , specifically starting with integrating  and  to manage save requests and prevent premature abortion. The last action indicates the engineer is addressing an issue with a missing  import related to this implementation.
