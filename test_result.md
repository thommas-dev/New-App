# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Test results: (1) ✅ Work order detail modal opens correctly, (2) ✅ Checklist tab accessible with proper count display 'Checklist (0/2)', (3) ✅ Can add new checklist items via input field, (4) ✅ Save Checklist button works correctly, (5) ✅ Success message 'Checklist saved successfully!' displays, (6) ✅ Existing checklist items (2 found) can be toggled, (7) ✅ Progress indicators update correctly. All user-reported checklist issues are now resolved. The complete checklist workflow from frontend to backend is fully operational."

        comment: "✅ CHECKLIST PERSISTENCE THOROUGHLY VERIFIED: Conducted comprehensive testing of the specific user-reported issue 'checklist changes don't persist after save/reopen cycle'. RESULTS: (1) ✅ Save → Close → Reopen workflow working perfectly, (2) ✅ All checklist modifications persist correctly (item count, completion status, metadata), (3) ✅ Multiple save/reopen cycles tested successfully (3 cycles completed), (4) ✅ Complex checklist data structure with completed_by and completed_at fields preserved, (5) ✅ Backend logs show all PUT/GET operations returning 200 OK, (6) ✅ MongoDB data persistence verified through retrieval tests. CONCLUSION: The backend checklist persistence functionality is working flawlessly. User's reported issue 'Save → Close → Reopen → Changes are gone' is NOT occurring in backend testing. If user still experiences this issue, it's likely a frontend caching or state management problem, not a backend persistence issue."
